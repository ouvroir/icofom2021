Por lo general, el tema es diferente cada año, pero a veces se analiza durante un período de tres años.</p><p>Los enfoques de la museología varían ampliamente en todo el mundo, por ejemplo, el uso de museos para hacer declaraciones sobre el nacionalismo tiene prioridad en algunos países. En otros, la conservación y la exhibición de artefactos altamente estéticos y no controvertidos se consideran los papeles principales de los museos. Por el contrario, en otras naciones, el desarrollo de “historias desde abajo” o el rescate de las historias de las vidas de personas que se consideraban sin valor, ahora es un enfoque museológico primario. La gran variedad internacional de museologías significa que la reunión anual tiene una importancia fundamental para la expresión y el registro de estas diferencias.</p><p>Cuando se anuncia la fecha de la reunión, la convocatoria de ponencias de la conferencia va acompañada de un documento provocativo que se publica en el sitio web que establece algunas de las vías para explorar cualquier tema en particular. Un panel editorial internacional actúa como un panel de árbitros que realiza una selección de artículos que se publican y están disponibles al comienzo de la conferencia. La reunión anual se desarrolla a través de un animado debate informado mediante la lectura previa de los documentos, en lugar de hacerlo mediante la entrega unilateral de documentos individuales.</p><p>Las reuniones tienen lugar en todo el mundo, lo que permite a los asistentes a la conferencia obtener información sobre una amplia gama de expresiones museológicas concretas.
