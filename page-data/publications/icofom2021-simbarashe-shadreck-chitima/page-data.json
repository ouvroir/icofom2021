Museums have also engaged local communities in the\\nmanagement of cultural sites through the Adopt 'A' site educational\\nprogramme. Areas cited by participants to be decolonised include: museum\\narchitecture, exhibitions and narratives, mind-set and curatorial\\ndemocracy, educational philosophy, language and methods of content\\ndelivery. It has been revealed that museum architectural design is\\nviewed as a European model. Suggestions are that museum architecture\\nshould reflect the designs on Zimbabwe type dry-stone or on Shona or\\nNdebele villages. Museum exhibitions and narratives are also considered\\ncolonial. It was suggested that exhibitions and narratives should be\\nreconstituted since these were done during the colonial period. White\\ncommunity participants expressed that although they pity colonialism,\\nthe decolonisation of museum narratives should be balanced so that the\\nwhite population living in Zimbabwe is not seen as evil which could\\ncontribute to segregation and xenophobia. The coloured community\\nindicated that they felt excluded from museums as there were no\\nrepresentations or content that related to them. It was gathered that\\ninstead of museums continuing to embrace colonial permanent exhibitions,\\nthey could change and talk about topical issues affecting society. For\\nexample, it was indicated that in 2020 the world, including Zimbabweans,\\nwere battling to contain the Corona Virus (Corvid 19).

Decolonisation of\\nmuseums is a negotiated process and not an instant one time project.\\nThere is need for strategies and principles (policy or action plans) of\\noperations because they help capture the terms and references and\\noperational guidelines of stakeholders to avoid conflicts.\\nDecolonisation of museums is not a one man band undertaking but require\\nall relevant stakeholders in order to avoid the former coloniser being\\ncolonised or further seclusion of politically weak smaller groups.\\nMuseums may assemble a decolonisation team constituted by local\\ncommunities, government agents and museum personnel. The third step is\\nto conduct a decolonisation audit which helps identify areas that\\nrequire to be decolonised. The areas that need to be decolonised differ\\nfrom one museum to the other. A number of areas have been suggested in\\nthe case of Zimbabwe that need to be decolonised such as the\\niconography, museum architecture, mental framework of staff, exhibitions\\nand narratives, interpretations, educational philosophy and method of\\ncontent delivery. Although the government in Zimbabwe renamed museums\\nthe majority of permanent exhibitions, narratives and interpretations as\\nwell as conduct remain colonial. The philosophy grounding museum\\neducation service needs to be re-examined in Zimbabwe. Mbembe (2015)\\npoints out that there is something wrong if museums continue to provide\\neducational content designed to meet the needs of the colonialist in the\\npost-colonial era. Museums still use English, scientific language and\\njargon as the dominant mode of communication on captions and guided\\ntours and these need to be decolonised. Chipangura (2014) recommended\\nthe use of diverse indigenous languages like Shona, Ndebele, Tonga,\\nNambya, Chewa, Kalanga, Shangani, Sotho, Venda and Xhosa. It is a known\\nfact that pupils learn effectively through their first languages (Gomba,\\n2017).\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Decolonisation of museums should also touch on the methods of content\\ndelivery. Guided tours and study sheets promote the Pedagogy of the\\nOppressed (Freire, 1970) where the museum visitor is reduced to passive\\nrecipient of information, needs to be repealed. They are other active\\nmethods of making visitors, including students, take ownership of their\\nmuseum experience and these are not limited to role playing, games,\\ndrama, song and dance, folk lore, music and interactives. Decolonising\\nthe museum is not an instant happening. As audiences continue to change,\\nmuseums will be required to constantly review themselves. New audiences\\nwill have new expectations and needs, hence the need for museums to\\nreview and conduct decolonisation audits time and again.\"), mdx(\"h2\", null, \"Conclusion\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Decolonisation of cultural institutions is a negotiated process that\\nrequire the participation of all relevant stakeholders the museum serve.\\nNational museums in Zimbabwe still live in a colonial shell and\\nexhibitions embrace the Western Museology.

Due to the health situation, the event will be held online from 15 to 18 March 2021.</p><p>The purpose of the ICOFOM Annual Meeting is to create an international forum for a high level discussion on a museological topic. Usually, the topic is different each year, but sometimes it is analyzed over a three year period.</p><p>Approaches to museology vary widely around the world, for example, using museums to make statements about nationalism is given priority in some countries. In others, conservation and the exhibition of highly aestheticized, non-controversial artefacts, are regarded as the primary roles for museums. By contrast, in other nations, the development of “histories from below” or the salvaging of the histories of the lives of people who were regarded as having no value, is now a primary museological focus. The wide international variety of museologies means that the annual meeting has fundamental importance for the expression and recording of these differences.</p><p>When the meeting date is announced, the call for conference papers is accompanied by a provocative paper which is published on the website setting out some of the avenues for exploration of any particular topic. An international editorial panel acts as a panel of referees making a selection of papers which are published and available at the beginning of the conference. The annual meeting proceeds via lively debate informed by prior reading of the papers, rather than via the unilateral delivery of individual papers.</p><p>The meetings take place all over the world allowing conference attendees to gain insight into a broad array of concrete museological expressions. Every three years the ICOFOM meeting takes place within the framework of the ICOM Triennial and is accompanied by elections which establish the executive committee and office bearers for the coming three years.</p>","about.icofomWebsite":"ICOFOM website","about.comitee":"Organizing Comittee:","about.localComitee":"Local Scientific Comittee:","about.scienceComitee":"ICOFOM Scientific Comittee:","program.description":"As the symposium is held online, the sessions emphasize discussion among participants.
