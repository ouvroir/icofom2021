Highlights of the city\\u2019s Ethnological Museum were paired with works from the collection of European sculptures of the Bode Museum in an attempt to create dialogues regarding different origins, provenances and histories. The show was part of a series of events preceding the opening of the Humboldt Forum, a major cultural center dedicated to house and exhibit part of the collections of Berlin\\u2019s Ethnological Museum and Museum of Asian Art, which was supposed to open on September 2020 after a one-year delay.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"The Forum is considered Germany\\u2019s most relevant cultural project at the beginning of the 21st century (Parzinger, 2011), and has as its mission to be a place for exchanges among cultures through art, science and research. It is the result of decades of intensive work aiming to guarantee Berlin\\u2019s position as a cosmopolitan center in Europe after Germany\\u2019s reunification in 1990. However, it is still not clear how the non-European collections will be displayed, in contrast to the shows that took place until 2017, when the ethnological museum was closed as it moved to the Forum. Hence the exhibition in the Bode Museum serves as a laboratory for the handling of cultural heritage with a colonial background, and the show is an effort to keep African masterpieces in public view.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"We analyze strategies adopted by the curators as they tried to put at the same level of fruition objects with such different histories. Julien Chapuis, the Bode Museum\\u2019s director of the Collection of Sculptures and Byzantine Art, with Paola Ivanov and Jonathan Fine, curators for Africa at the Ethological Museum, take as the main issue the way Berliner collections were organized and why some objects were sent to a museum of ethnology while others were integrated into an art museum (Chapuis, Fine & Ivanov, 2017, p. 6). They organized the show in two major sections, where African and European objects co-existed and thematic intersections were created to organize groups of artworks. Besides occupying the room for temporary exhibitions of the Bode Museum, the curators established 22 groups of objects in which a European piece was put in front of an African one, a strategy they called \", mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"juxtapositions\"), \". These groups were distributed among the rooms of the museum where the permanent exhibition is shown.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Based on two core instances, the curators developed a methodological basis that made it possible to exhibit and compare the objects in an aimed common frame. This was done by questioning the museological \", mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"savoir-faire\"), \" that historically characterized both museums. Their reflections point out the production of differences among Western and non-Western cultures and how these hierarchical differences influence the way comparisons between European and non-European material culture are made. In addition to the historical and political background within the collections, they set the terms on the way information about each object was displayed on the labels. Finally, they introduced among objects of previous centuries two self-portraits of an African female contemporary artist. In the following sections we examine the choices adopted by the curators and reach preliminary conclusions on how this 25-month show contributed to museal practices and lessons for the Humboldt Forum.\"), mdx(\"h2\", null, \"Comparisons as power enunciations\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"The curators invited visitors to reflect on the way comparisons are\\nprojected among objects in a museum. A wall text in the show presented\\nthis idea, which is also detailed in the exhibition's catalogue, where\\nthey create the arrangement to sustain their view of how comparisons\\nshould be taken within the show. In the catalogue's essay, the ideas of\\ntwo consulted authors deserve greater attention in order to understand\\nthe background of comparisons in an atmosphere of unequal power. Fabian\\n(2013) discusses the \\\"denial of coevalness\\\", a situation in which the\\n\", mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"self\"), \" denies to the \", mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"other\"), \" the possibility of belonging to the same\\nhistorical era.

Chapuis, Fine and\\nIvanov, (2017, p. 11) stress that to define what is different or alike\\nis more a matter of epistemology and power than perspective. Examining\\nthe act of comparing itself, the curators refer to a writing of\\nRadhakrishnan (2009) in which he establishes conditions upon which\\nepistemological comparisons can be done despite the colonial act of\\nsurpassing the \", mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"other\"), \"'s system of knowledge and expecting to impose\\nthat of the \", mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"self.\"), \" In his vision, \\\"emerging realities in different\\nparts of the world are both historically disparate and coeval with one\\nanother\\\" (Radhakrishnan, 2009, pp. 455-456).\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"By transferring the contributions of both authors to the Berliner set of\\npublic museums, the Ethnological Museum can be seen as a place dedicated\\nto exhibiting and preserving artefacts of cultures whose fate was either\\nto disappear by extinction or to be no longer produced by colonized\\ngroups. The Bode Museum was the institution devoted to preserving\\nhighlights of European art from late-Antiquity until the 18th century,\\nwith an especial bias to the Italian Renaissance, as the museum's\\nfounder, Wilhelm von Bode, was Jacob Burckhardt's pupil. In \\\"Beyond\\nCompare\\\", the curators aim to establish new conditions for Western and\\nnon-Western material culture to share not only the same space but also\\nepistemological legitimacy. Nevertheless, facts concerning the way\\nAfrican objects turned out to be part of the Ethnological Museum make it\\na hard task to conceive.\"), mdx(\"h2\", null, \"The label issue\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"The condition of African artworks gains visibility when we examine how\\nthe curators handled the display of available information on the labels.\\nThey developed a common model of display for European and African works\\nsince the provenance of many European objects is not as noticeable as it\\nappears to be. In the catalogue, the curatorial team describes the\\ndecisions behind the developed model of labels. Chapuis, Fine and Ivanov\\n(2017, pp. 17-18) warn the visitors and readers that the displayed\\ninformation should be taken as a kick-off for further research on each\\npiece and not as a conclusive investigative process. Museological\\nsystems of classification are essentially constructions, therefore,\\nprovisional and open for new evaluations, say the curators.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"A key aspect of this approach consists of not showing what they do not\\nknow when it comes to the authorship of each piece. Based on this\\nincompleteness, they have decided to leave a \\\"metaphorical empty space\\\"\\non the label instead of writing 'unknown artist'. They stand for the\\nview the works were done by individuals and not cultures (Chapuis, Fine\\n& Ivanov, 2017, p. 17), while Baxandall (1991) would have recommended\\nincorporating a concept attached to the culture that originated a piece\\nfor addressing cultural difference. A look at the works enabled us to\\nexpand the discussion initialized by the curators to the power relations\\nbehind the formation of museums.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"From a total of 78 African artworks, 62 are dated in the 19^th^ and\\nbeginning of the 20^th^ century, a time when almost the entire Africa\\nwas split into colonial constituencies ruled by European powers.

Only one African piece is from a\\npre-colonial time, even though the time gap extends from the 12^th^ to\\nthe 15^th^ centuries. Clearly, the colonial period is a main reference\\nto establish a timeline for the African objects. This also indicates a\\ncentral difference between African and European objects: the colonial\\nviolence inherent to the acquisition of many African pieces. Additional\\nevidence of this condition is found in that many of the objects were\\nobtained from former colonial chiefs, like Robert Visser, or as spoils\\nof war sold by merchants, like the Benin Bronzes acquired in England at\\nthe beginning of the 20^th^ century.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Consequently, information concerning the origins and meaning of African\\nworks shows more accurately the net of power that brought them to the\\nmuseum and the kind of objects that were attractive to the eyes of\\nEuropean collectors, rather than serving as a trustworthy source of\\nreferencing. Furthermore, individualizing authorship can obliterate\\nmultiple relations of production, especially those attached to a\\ncollective act of creation and transmission of knowledge.\"), mdx(\"h2\", null, \"The artist as index\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"One last remark concerning the curatorial approach on exposing Berlin's\\nmuseological architecture is related to the presence of the two\\nself-portraits of the South-African contemporary artist Nomusa Makhubu,\\nin which she manipulates the visuality of ethnological photography by\\nprojecting it on her body of a black woman. Her presence in a show not\\nfocused on contemporary production serves as a feature to indicate that\\nthe colonial past was somehow taken into consideration. It is,\\ntherefore, an index of how this theme has occupied the curators. This\\nstrategy, already implemented in similar shows outside Germany, is an\\nattempt to mediate the background African objects in museums of the\\nGlobal North and contemporize this problem to the present day.\"), mdx(\"h2\", null, \"Final considerations\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"'Beyond Compare' took place in a time when the \", mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"status\"), \" of non-Western\\ncollections is being questioned among specialists and organizations from\\nboth the North and the Global South.

This delicate question was particularly visible when\\nexamining the strategy behind the objects' labels, which was\\ninsufficient to cover both traces of colonial violence contained in the\\nobjects from Africa and cultural entanglement related to the use and\\nmeaning of masks and statues. The option of the \\\"metaphorical empty\\nspace\\\" for unknown authorships indicates a curatorial view that values\\nthe person of the maker instead of cultural relations around the object,\\nwhich in some cases then excludes social interaction and traditions that\\ngo beyond the creativity of an individual.

Usually, the topic is different each year, but sometimes it is analyzed over a three year period.</p><p>Approaches to museology vary widely around the world, for example, using museums to make statements about nationalism is given priority in some countries. In others, conservation and the exhibition of highly aestheticized, non-controversial artefacts, are regarded as the primary roles for museums. By contrast, in other nations, the development of “histories from below” or the salvaging of the histories of the lives of people who were regarded as having no value, is now a primary museological focus. The wide international variety of museologies means that the annual meeting has fundamental importance for the expression and recording of these differences.</p><p>When the meeting date is announced, the call for conference papers is accompanied by a provocative paper which is published on the website setting out some of the avenues for exploration of any particular topic. An international editorial panel acts as a panel of referees making a selection of papers which are published and available at the beginning of the conference. The annual meeting proceeds via lively debate informed by prior reading of the papers, rather than via the unilateral delivery of individual papers.</p><p>The meetings take place all over the world allowing conference attendees to gain insight into a broad array of concrete museological expressions.
