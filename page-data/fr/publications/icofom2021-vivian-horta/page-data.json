En raison de la situation sanitaire, l’événement se tiendra en ligne du 15 au 18 mars 2021.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Le but de la réunion annuelle de l’ICOFOM est de créer un forum international pour un débat de haut niveau sur un sujet muséologique. Généralement, le sujet est différent chaque année, mais il est parfois analysé sur une période de trois ans.</p><p>Les approches en matière de muséologie varient considérablement d’un pays à l’autre. Par exemple, l’utilisation de musées pour faire des déclarations sur le nationalisme est une priorité dans certains pays. Dans d’autres, la conservation et l’exposition d’artefacts hautement esthétisés et non controversés sont considérés comme les rôles principaux des musées. En revanche, dans d’autres pays, le développement de « l’histoire populaire » ou la récupération des récits de vies de personnes considérées comme sans valeur est devenu un objectif muséologique primaire. La grande variété de muséologies internationales signifie que la réunion annuelle revêt une importance fondamentale pour l’expression et l’enregistrement de ces différences.</p><p>Lorsque la date de la réunion est annoncée, l’appel à contributions est accompagné d’un document provocateur qui est publié sur le site Web et qui présente des possibles explorations d’un sujet particulier. Un comité éditorial international fait office de groupe d’arbitres qui sélectionnent les articles publiés et disponibles au début de la conférence. La réunion annuelle se déroule par le biais d’un débat animé, éclairé par la lecture préalable des documents, plutôt que par la présentation unilatérale de documents individuels.</p><p>Les réunions ont lieu partout dans le monde, permettant aux participants de se familiariser avec un large éventail d’expressions muséologiques concrètes.
