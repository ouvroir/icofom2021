They are repeated at different times in the\\ndifferent countries. The problem should therefore be reformatted: can\\nsuch processes be considered as the decolonization of the cultural\\nfield? I think, no, they cannot. First, the term decolonization has\\nenduring connotations in scientific discourse, and it is used by\\npolitical science to describe another group of events. Secondly, we\\nshould use our own terminology for our description of cultural\\nprocesses. The way we describe the problem and terms we use are also\\nreflected in our social practices regarding tangible and intangible\\nheritage. Today in a multicultural society, various discourses can be\\noffered in discussing a problem. But the politically colored narrative\\nproposed for the 43^th^ ICOFOM Symposium introduces an element of\\ncontention and aggressiveness into the field of culture, in opposition\\nto the goals of sustainable development of society.

The\\nsocialization of large groups of migrants is occurring through museums\\nin many countries---there are museums of migration in Italy, Germany,\\nAustralia, Ireland. The adoption of otherness led to a democracy,\\nequality and sustainable development. In a multicultural society the\\nmuseum is the most important communication platform that can conduct\\ndialogue with any cultural community.

Smith.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"The history of organizing museums in Russia reveals the instrumental\\ncapabilities of museum which are used by different social and\\nprofessional groups to attain their goals within society.

The analysis of the Materials for Discussion proposed for\\nthe symposium in Kyoto assures us of this. Significant inclusion of\\nvarious social groups into the museum's sphere necessarily makes\\nheritage a subject of multilateral discussion of what values \\u200B\\u200Band\\nmeanings it gives birth to.

Généralement, le sujet est différent chaque année, mais il est parfois analysé sur une période de trois ans.</p><p>Les approches en matière de muséologie varient considérablement d’un pays à l’autre. Par exemple, l’utilisation de musées pour faire des déclarations sur le nationalisme est une priorité dans certains pays. Dans d’autres, la conservation et l’exposition d’artefacts hautement esthétisés et non controversés sont considérés comme les rôles principaux des musées. En revanche, dans d’autres pays, le développement de «&nbsp;l’histoire populaire&nbsp;» ou la récupération des récits de vies de personnes considérées comme sans valeur est devenu un objectif muséologique primaire. La grande variété de muséologies internationales signifie que la réunion annuelle revêt une importance fondamentale pour l’expression et l’enregistrement de ces différences.</p><p>Lorsque la date de la réunion est annoncée, l’appel à contributions est accompagné d’un document provocateur qui est publié sur le site Web et qui présente des possibles explorations d’un sujet particulier. Un comité éditorial international fait office de groupe d’arbitres qui sélectionnent les articles publiés et disponibles au début de la conférence. La réunion annuelle se déroule par le biais d’un débat animé, éclairé par la lecture préalable des documents, plutôt que par la présentation unilatérale de documents individuels.</p><p>Les réunions ont lieu partout dans le monde, permettant aux participants de se familiariser avec un large éventail d’expressions muséologiques concrètes.
