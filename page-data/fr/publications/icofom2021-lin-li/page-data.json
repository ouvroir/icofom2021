Five\\ncharacteristics\\xA0were found in the Chinese understanding of repatriation\\nof objects lost during colonial times. Firstly, the Chinese often\\nassociate the return of cultural objects lost during the colonial period\\nwith China\\u2019s national strength. Many people believe that the reason for\\nrepatriation is a powerful China. At the same time, the return of\\nobjects from foreign museums to China appears to be strong evidence of\\nChina\\u2019s increasing national strength. The Chinese always prefer\\nstrength rather than morality as their judgment code, which is\\nessentially a distrust of and disrespect for an equal and open\\ninternational cultural conversation. Secondly, from the perspective of\\nmost Chinese people, the value of repatriation is to prove China\\u2019s\\nincreasing international influence and improve China\\u2019s global status.\\nAt the same time, the returned objects are often perceived as a tool to\\nattract more foreigners to come to China and receive Chinese culture,\\nwhich will help China prevail in the world\\u2019s cultural competition.\\nThirdly, the Chinese attention to the returned object is limited to the\\nstories before it left China. At the same time, many Chinese people\\nthink that the object has lost its real value since leaving China. They\\nrarely care about or acknowledge the foreigner\\u2019s interpretation of an\\nobject, which is a Chinese-centralized and exclusive attitude towards\\nthe repatriated object. Fourthly, the Chinese always take a national\\nperspective on the return of cultural objects. On the one hand, the\\nimportance to the nation is the main and primary significance of\\nrepatriation. Many people think that objects which are valuable to the\\ncountry should be considered for return first. On the other hand, the\\nnational and governmental organizations are the main stakeholders of\\nrepatriation and should participate in the decision-making process. This\\napproach of prioritizing the national perspective has largely restrained\\nthe diverse value of cultural objects. Finally, Chinese people are used\\nto ignoring and dwarfing the personal perspective in repatriation. On\\nthe one hand, personal property is not respected, as many Chinese do not\\nsupport returning the object to its original owner and his or her\\ndescendants. On the other hand, people think that the return of cultural\\nobjects does not have personal importance to them. When their personal\\nopinions conflict with the nation\\u2019s will, they will hand the priority\\nover to the nation. In this case, the personal connection between\\nrepatriation and each individual is weak in China.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Thus, repatriation for colonial reasons in China has almost nothing to\\nwith decolonization, even though many Chinese experts and scholars\\nregard colonial expansion and war as some of the main reasons for the\\nloss of cultural objects. Chinese people also strongly demand the return\\nof the objects. However, most people in China are unfamiliar with and\\neven ignorant of decolonization. Decolonization has never been the\\npurpose or motivation of the return of Chinese objects. Repatriation is\\na political issue, with the purpose of shaping a powerful and\\ninfluential China. The Chinese understanding of repatriation is full of\\nexclusiveness and inequality based on the national perspective and\\nChinese-centralization ideology. This kind of repatriation risks the\\nloss of cultural diversity and is far from the value of decolonization.\\nThe essence of repatriation should be the canceling of inequalities and\\nthe promotion of diverse perspectives of knowledge. The process of\\nrepatriation is not equal to the task of prioritizing the source\\nnation's interpretation and ideology. In that case, repatriation will\\nlead to another kind of inequality. Instead of that, an object's return\\nshould commit as well to bringing people back to an equal conversation\\nbased on critical thinking, rational analysis, and self-determination.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Finally, Chinese museums are not on the path of decolonization now. In\\nChina, the museum is a national cultural propaganda institution\\npromoting the nation\\u2019s interests and prioritizing Chinese values. Its\\nmission is to provide Chinese people with cultural and political\\neducation and export Chinese culture abroad. At the same time, the\\nChinese audience\\u2019s participation in the museum is superficial. The\\naudiences are excluded from the operation and decision-making systems of\\nmuseums.
