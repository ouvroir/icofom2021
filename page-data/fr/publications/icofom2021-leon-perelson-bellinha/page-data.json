Museology is the science or practice of\\norganizing, arranging, and managing museums. And what are museums?\\nCurrently, the International Council of Museums\\u2019 official definition\\nstates that a museum is a \\\"non-profit, permanent institution in the\\nservice of society and its development, open to the public, which\\nacquires, conserves, researches, communicates and exhibits the tangible\\nand intangible heritage of humanity and its environment for the purposes\\nof education, study and enjoyment\\\". However, this definition can change\\n-- and it already has. By focusing on the social history of museums, I\\nwish to uncover the changing roles of the institution and the issues\\nhindering the process of decolonization.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Firstly, to properly grasp the meaning of decolonization, we need to\\nacknowledge how colonization is still present in modern society. When\\nthe colonizers plundered everything they could, the colonies were forced\\nto endure all the pain to prevent further attacks. Consequently, these\\ntwo societies became unquestionably entangled. This can be most notably\\nidentified within the social realm of former colonies\\u2019 everyday life,\\nsuch as the dominant language spoken.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Nonetheless, museologists usually look at these societies as two\\ndifferent and separate ones instead of two different ones with a common\\npast, which translates itself in the present as an intrinsic bind\\nbetween two countries. It is unfair to treat those countries as the\\ncolonizers are treated since they never became fully postcolonial\\nbecause the colonizers never left their countries to create themselves\\norganically. There are countries younger than fifty years old (e.g.\\nAngola (independent since 1975), Djibouti (independent since 1977), and\\nMicronesia (independent since 1986)). Moreover, the smaller societies\\n(indigenous or religious) inside a country are also not respected as\\ntheir own because they are seen as a figment of others.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"As a result, the museal field continuously perpetuates the myth of a\\nsingle homogeneous society within a given former colony, when they\\nshould be in fact, paving the way towards decolonization. But what\\nexactly does this path entail and how is it possible for museums to put\\nthis into practice? In order to find the answers to these questions, it\\nis necessary to address the roots of this issue: the creation of the\\nfirst museums and the birth of a new field of study.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"It is vital to understand the context behind the process of museum\\ncreation. Questions arise regarding how collections were acquired and\\nconsequently how they were and still are displayed, and how the wording\\nof texts affects public perception. Where were these museums built, what\\nwas their purpose? The answers to these questions might be obvious to\\nmuseologists, but how this relates to present-day museums and how to fix\\nthe problem is not obvious at all.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"A museum is a place to try to engage in critical dialogues regarding the\\npast and future of communities and nations, trying to understand their\\ncomplex histories and learn from the mistakes made throughout their\\nexistence. History might be dark and ethically dubious at times, but all\\nmust engage with it, nevertheless. Undertaking such a process requires\\nus to understand the root of the issues faced in the field of museum\\nstudies. It is at the beginning of the museum\\u2019s history that the problem\\nstarted, when the world was still largely under colonial rule, and\\ncollectors mostly acquired objects by questionable means.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Although objects were at times also bought by or gifted to colonial\\nforces, they were most commonly simply claimed and taken. Even when\\npieces were legally acquired, the colonized participated out of fear,\\nhoping to avoid further exploitation. Furthermore, it is important to\\ntalk about how these are then displayed in museums. Every part of the\\nmuseography matters, but the one that influences the most on people\\u2019s\\nviews on some object or some population is the expography.

The first modern museums were\\nformed by the private collections of wealthy families, people, and\\ninstitutions, among others. These so-called \\\\\\\"wonder rooms\\\" or \\\"cabinets\\nof curiosities\\u2019\\u2019, were found to display almost anything ranging from\\nart and tools to entire specimens of exotic fauna and flora. Modern\\nmuseums, however, started to appear in Europe in the late 15^th^ to\\nearly 16^th^ centuries and consisted mainly of European art.\\nFurthermore, early museums, which preceded the term itself,\\nconsequently, museums and the field of studies created thereafter were\\nborn from and perpetuated a Eurocentric worldview.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"When diving even further into the history of museums, it is possible to\\ncome to the conclusion about the purpose of early modern museums:\\ntestament of power. Being able to afford to go traveling or to buy art\\nis and has always been something that most cannot do. Ergo, all to whom\\nthis was a possibility and ultimately displayed their collections were\\nmembers of the upper class or connected to powerful institutions. The\\nmost powerful members of society, such as the nobility, were exclusively\\nthe ones who could afford to travel and bring back souvenirs to add to\\ntheir collections and put them in museums.

This is slowly changing\\nas the field starts to place more value upon local cultures. Museums in\\nFrance to New Zealand and Brazil are paving the way towards\\ndecolonization. The process of decolonizing is hard and can be damaging\\nto museums in Europe, but is a path that must be followed to correct the\\nmistakes of the past and try to make amends with societies that were\\nexploited. This process will depend on two factors, however: 1) the\\ncolonizer or colonized country 2) The reality of settlement and\\nexploitation during colonization.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"In different countries, different types of decolonization are necessary.\\nWhat is common in all ways to decolonize the museum is the goal: start\\nengaging in a critical dialogue about the past and future of the nations\\nand communities involved.

Nevertheless, that is not\\neasy per se; it is only the most easily achievable goal. One action and\\nmost of the issues that are reminiscent of colonization are resolved.\\nHowever, this is not a magical solution and it is also not new. All\\naround the globe, for some time, the museal field have been discussing\\nthis. The biggest problems that were brought to light because of this\\ndebate are: 1) the museums in the countries that would receive the\\nobjects may not have the infrastructure to take care of them. 2) The\\nmuseums that are returning the objects would lose a big part of their\\ncollections, causing a defective teaching potential.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"For the first problem, the difficulty is that there is not one way to\\nhandle these cases. Every case must be treated as unique. Furthermore,\\nit is usually a battle of egos: both sides judge themselves more fit\\nthan the other to have the object in question. Many factors must be\\ntaken into account, such as the importance of the object (for both the\\ngiver and receiver); the ability of the museum to take care of the\\nobject; the historical issue (determining which objects fit in the\\ncategory of \\\"must be returned\\\"). This battle can be settled through\\nlegal action in court, in a meeting between the two museum directors or\\nanother way. The most used argument to defend that something should stay\\nwhere they are is the fact that the Europeans museums usually deem third\\nworld country museums unfit. That can be true, but even when it is not,\\nthey do not want to let go of the object because of its value to the\\nmuseum. The solution should always be in favor of the object. When the\\nmuseum is unable to perform all the preservation measures, they should\\nnot have the object.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"The second problem will only appear after the first one is dealt with\\nand quite easily solved.

So not only decolonizing the museal field is needed, but also\\ndestigmatizing it in certain places. One clear example that only\\ndecolonization is not very effective is the Indigenous Museum in Rio de\\nJaneiro, which closed due to a lack of visitors.

Par exemple, l’utilisation de musées pour faire des déclarations sur le nationalisme est une priorité dans certains pays.

En revanche, dans d’autres pays, le développement de « l’histoire populaire » ou la récupération des récits de vies de personnes considérées comme sans valeur est devenu un objectif muséologique primaire. La grande variété de muséologies internationales signifie que la réunion annuelle revêt une importance fondamentale pour l’expression et l’enregistrement de ces différences.</p><p>Lorsque la date de la réunion est annoncée, l’appel à contributions est accompagné d’un document provocateur qui est publié sur le site Web et qui présente des possibles explorations d’un sujet particulier. Un comité éditorial international fait office de groupe d’arbitres qui sélectionnent les articles publiés et disponibles au début de la conférence. La réunion annuelle se déroule par le biais d’un débat animé, éclairé par la lecture préalable des documents, plutôt que par la présentation unilatérale de documents individuels.</p><p>Les réunions ont lieu partout dans le monde, permettant aux participants de se familiariser avec un large éventail d’expressions muséologiques concrètes.
