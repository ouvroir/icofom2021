The theme of decolonization has penetrated the\\nthinking of the international museum community for several years now.\\nDecolonization raises questions about the origin of a country and its\\nown culture.

Thus, until the beginning of\\nthe twenty-first century, Canadian museums, in particular, offered a\\nnational history that began with the discovery of America by Europeans\\nin the sixteenth century.

These various points of view are visible in\\nCanadian national museums, but it took strong action by the First\\nNations peoples for national museums to become aware of their\\nresponsibilities in terms of decolonization, and for museum associations\\nand governments to become involved in the emancipation process\\n(Phillips, 2011; Clifford, 2013; Sleeper-Smith, 2009).\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Contrary to origin myths in the Americas and elsewhere in the world,\\ncultural history is made up of \", mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"m\\xE9tissages\"), \" (\\\"mixes\\\"\", mdx(\"sup\", {\n    parentName: \"p\",\n    \"id\": \"fnref-1\"\n  }, mdx(\"a\", {\n    parentName: \"sup\",\n    \"href\": \"#fn-1\",\n    \"className\": \"footnote-ref\"\n  }, \"1\")), \") and\\nhybridization (Turgeon, 2003), and is fundamentally opposed to the very\\nidea of \\u200B\\u200Bcultural homogeneity.

Due to the health situation, the event will be held online from 15 to 18 March 2021.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The purpose of the ICOFOM Annual Meeting is to create an international forum for a high level discussion on a museological topic. Usually, the topic is different each year, but sometimes it is analyzed over a three year period.</p><p>Approaches to museology vary widely around the world, for example, using museums to make statements about nationalism is given priority in some countries. In others, conservation and the exhibition of highly aestheticized, non-controversial artefacts, are regarded as the primary roles for museums. By contrast, in other nations, the development of “histories from below” or the salvaging of the histories of the lives of people who were regarded as having no value, is now a primary museological focus. The wide international variety of museologies means that the annual meeting has fundamental importance for the expression and recording of these differences.</p><p>When the meeting date is announced, the call for conference papers is accompanied by a provocative paper which is published on the website setting out some of the avenues for exploration of any particular topic. An international editorial panel acts as a panel of referees making a selection of papers which are published and available at the beginning of the conference. The annual meeting proceeds via lively debate informed by prior reading of the papers, rather than via the unilateral delivery of individual papers.</p><p>The meetings take place all over the world allowing conference attendees to gain insight into a broad array of concrete museological expressions. Every three years the ICOFOM meeting takes place within the framework of the ICOM Triennial and is accompanied by elections which establish the executive committee and office bearers for the coming three years.</p>","about.icofomWebsite":"ICOFOM website","about.comitee":"Organizing Comittee:","about.localComitee":"Local Scientific Comittee:","about.scienceComitee":"ICOFOM Scientific Comittee:","program.description":"As the symposium is held online, the sessions emphasize discussion among participants.
