The Karajá people today live in 20 villages along the Araguaia River in
the north-central part of Brazil, amounting to 3000 individuals. They
call themselves *Iny* and speak the *inyribè* language. In their
society, the social position of women ceramists is paramount, as they
possess the know-how, transmitted from one generation to another, that
embodies features of what it is to be Karajá (Leitão, 2015). Contrary to
what one might imagine, the master ceramists are not the ones who model
best, but those who dominate the burning of the pieces, a very complex
process which ensures that they do not break. \"Only a dry wood
(*Hulalaò*) serves to burn the ceramic doll,\" says an indigenous man
who holds a master\'s degree from the Federal University of Tocantins
(Karajá, 2015). And so we discover the Karajá people not only through
the studies of others but through their intellectual production.

The *Iny/*Karajá villages are spread across four Brazilian states, but
the ceramic centres are at Bananal Island, the largest river island in
the world, and Aruanã city. The villages underwent a massive impact from
the 1930s onwards when the region became the target of public policies
of interiorization and occupation. Due to commercialization, the
production of Karajá dolls, originally intended to be children\'s toys,
little by little adapted to the taste of tourists. It is not a stylistic
\'evolution\' since the old type of dolls are still produced alongside
the new one.

The Karajá dolls, called *ritxoko*, are shaped in either wax alone, or
clay - raw or baked - plus wax. Playing with the dolls is a way of
socializing children in the customs and practices of the Karajá people,
its rich cosmology and the relationship of the indigenous people with
the Araguaia river and its fauna. All over the world, museums have
collected *ritxoko* since the 19th century. In 2012 it was listed as
immaterial cultural heritage by the Brazilian Institute of National and
Artistic Heritage, positively impacting its commercialization and the
perception of its cultural value.

To understand the relations between intangible heritage and museum
collections the project "'*Presença Karajá*': material culture, weft and
colonial transits\" started in 2017. It has been mapping *ritxoko*
collections in museums in Brazil and worldwide, having already listed 74
institutions in 16 countries; the oldest collections found date back to
the mid-nineteenth century. While we map collections, collaborating to
improve their documentation, we research their formation, which involves
processes of material and symbolic exchange between indigenous and
non-indigenous people which mostly emerged from processes of colonial
exploitation.

The history of ethnographic collections in museums follows different
paths depending on the institution and the country. The formation of
these collections became a field of study in anthropology, addressing
topics ranging from the motivation of collectors to intercultural
exchanges between anthropologists and studied groups, accessed through
the study of material culture. One of the most pressing aspects of these
studies concerns the selection of objects that make up the collections,
as well as the curatorial perspectives employed by museums
(Fienup-Riordan, 2010; Macdougall and Carlson, 2009; Engelstad, 2010).
Who makes, how and why certain objects are selected over others to
represent a specific culture, why some objects are displayed while
others remain locked in storehouses are questions on which the studies
of material culture have focused in recent decades.

Another important aspect of this debate concerns so-called decolonial
studies, which brings the researchers\' focus to different forms of
engagement of indigenous groups in the process of formation and
diffusion of ethnographic collections. Some of these studies reveal that
processes inherent to the museological operative chain take the original
owners away from the construction of meaning and narratives about
ethnographic objects (Knowles, 2013).

Lately, the decision-making process of what will be collected, studied
and, mainly, exhibited has experienced new developments. Successful
examples of shared curatorship (Fienup-Riordan, 2010; Macdougall and
Carlson, 2009; Engelstad, 2010), collaborative research (Silva, 2012)
and the establishment of indigenous museums (Vidal, 2013), has empowered
the voice of these communities within museums. The framework for these
experiences is grounded on a new ethic within which museums have to be
open to other narratives and practices, in a healthy exercise of
coexistence and collaboration with the communities of origin of the
museums\' collections (Marstine, 2011).

However, in most museums, the ethnographic collections still reflect the
view of experts, curators and researchers in defining what visitors will
share. Society, and especially indigenous people, have little influence
on the processes of selection, storage and sharing of information about
these collections. It is worth adding to this scenario the cases of
ethnographic objects that have never been exposed or even studied,
remaining for decades locked in the storehouse (Knowles, 2013).
Therefore, their potential for academic, cultural and touristic uses
remains unexplored, undermining their social relevance. In Brazil, the
national historical-social narrative obliterates indigenous people's
material cultures and history (Cury et al., 2012).

Assuming that digital technologies can foster access to indigenous
collections, we are building an online repository for digital
collections, named Tainacan. Built on free software, Tainacan was
developed by a team of researchers from the Federal University of Goiás,
in partnership with the Ministry of Culture and the Brazilian Institute
of Museums. We expect Tainacan to be a reference for the establishment
of a national policy for digital collections. Currently, it is being
used by several public and private cultural institutions, seeking future
interoperability between different institutional collections. According
to its developers, Tainacan:

> \[\...\] aims to incorporate various functionalities that facilitate
> interoperability with social media and the engagement of users in
> their management and maintenance of the repository, and hence to
> become a reference in the perspective of digital repositories.
> Tainacan is to be easy to use, configure and implement; a free and
> efficient alternative for cultural institutions that seek to implement
> thematic and institutional repositories.

The use of digital repositories for cultural collections is already a
reality in different parts of the world. However, for technical,
political and/or institutional reasons, Brazil still does not have a
policy for the preservation of cultural collections via digital
repositories. Repositories are collections of digital objects (images,
documents, music, etc., digitized), sorted and made available, via the
Internet (Martins et al., 2017). The guarantee of preservation and the
possibility of sharing metadata, through protocols, are also part of the
definition of a digital repository. Additionally, digital repositories
are important communication tools, widening public access to the
museum\'s collections.

The framework of our project is aligned with the Recommendation
Concerning the Protection and Promotion of Museums and Collections,
Their Diversity and Their Role in Society, according to which:

> In instances where the cultural heritage of indigenous peoples is
> represented in museum collections, Member States should take
> appropriate measures to encourage and facilitate dialogue and the
> building of constructive relationships between those museums and
> indigenous peoples concerning the management of those collections,
> and, where appropriate, return or restitution following applicable
> laws and policies. (Unesco, 2015).

Working on processes of identification, systematization and
dissemination of heritage references of the *Iny/*Karajá culture, the
project takes part in the complex thread of strategies to represent
indigenous people in the museal world. And adhering to digital
strategies of collections management and diffusion we intend to promote
\'digital restitution\' to indigenous people, allowing access to their
collections, which are usually geographically scattered. Furthermore, it
also feeds back the ceramists\' inspiration and craftsmanship.
