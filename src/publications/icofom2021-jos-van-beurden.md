During five centuries of European colonial expansion, a massive flow of
objects of cultural and historical importance to Europe took place. A
large number ended up in public and private museums. Many such museums
in, for instance, France, Germany, Great Britain, the Scandinavian
countries, Belgium and the Netherlands no longer deny that part of this
flow consisted of spoils of war, involuntarily lost and other tainted
objects. At the same time, governments and museums in former colonies
such as Nigeria, the Republic of Benin, Ghana, Namibia, Peru, Indonesia,
Sri Lanka or China want to retrieve part of these objects and come up
with specified return-claims.

Based on interdisciplinary research, this contribution answers the
question why the debate about contestable objects from former colonial
contexts has become so topical, both in former colonies and in European
countries. It does so by describing different phases and discourses in
the 'return debate' since 1945. The first and fairly hard one started
after the independence of colonies in Asia and Africa. Claims were
generally formulated, while returns were incidental. The second and
softer one was dominated by development aid from the late 1960s to the
late 1980s. Some former colonisers (Belgium, the Netherlands, Australia,
Denmark) returned objects. The third one began around the turn of the
century with changing global relations, new ethics in western museums, a
role for the immigrants from former colonies in Europe and North America
and better equipped former colonies with more specified claims.

The contribution dwells specifically on the third period and describes
the ways in which different former colonies and European countries deal
with the new challenge. It offers examples of successful returns and
rejected claims, and of differences between museums in one and the same
country. It well argue that the shifts in accents in provenance research
are a major characteristic of this third phase.

With special attention for a case-study from the Netherlands, a
ceremonial canon of the King of Kandy in the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam.
Soldiers of the Dutch East India Company had captured it from him in
1765 and since the 1880s it has been in the Rijksmuseum. In 1980, Sri
Lanka submitted a request for its return, but this was rejected. In
2017, the Rijksmuseum started a pilot-project for provenance research
and included the canon in it. In 2019, the museum went to Sri Lanka to
set up a collaborative research-project for the canon. That year, Sri
Lanka repeated its claim. In my contribution I will expand on the
progress of this project and the reactions on it in Colombo.
